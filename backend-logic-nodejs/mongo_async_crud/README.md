### Academic Honesty

**ROUTES**
GET http://localhost:3500/users: must be logged in, have a token in Auth Bearer, and have appropriate role
POST http://localhost:3500/auth: to sign in with username and pwd
POST http://localhost:3500/register: to register with username and pwd and receive RefreshToken as a cookie and AccessToken as a response
GET http://localhost:3500/logout: to logout
GET http://localhost:3500/refresh: to have RefreshToken as a cookie (meaning to perform auth first), and receive new AccessToken as response
